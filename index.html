    <h2>Movie Quote</h2>
      <p> We're all traveling through time together, every day of our lives. All we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride.</p>
      <p> Maybe, just maybe, I'm the faller. every family has someone who falls, who doesn't make the grade, who stumbles, who life trips up. Maybe I'm our faller.</p>
      <p> &lt; Spoiler  alert &gt; <span class = "spoil-protect"> And in the end I think I've learned the final lesson from my travels in time; and I've even gone one step further than my father did: The truth is I now don't travel back at all, not even for the day, I just try to live every day as if I've deliberately come back to this one day, to enjoy it, as if it was the full final day of my extraordinary, ordinary life. </span></p>
    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>When Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) is 21, his father (Bill Nighy) tells him a secret: The men in their family can travel through time. Although he can't change history, Tim resolves to improve his life by getting a girlfriend. He meets Mary (Rachel McAdams), falls in love and finally wins her heart via time-travel and a little cunning. However, as his unusual life progresses, Tim finds that his special ability can't shield him and those he loves from the problems of ordinary life.</p>
